# FeedForwardNeuralNetwork
This is a feed forward neural network programmed from scratch in python, designed to recognise unique handwritten digits (from 0-9).
This project was solely to understand how feed forward and other neural networks perform in a mathematical environment instead of the conventional library for 
example tensorflow and pytorch.
